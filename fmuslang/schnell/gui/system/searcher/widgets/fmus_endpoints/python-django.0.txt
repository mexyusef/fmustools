Sure! Here's an example of a Django REST framework controller class for creating a table called "todo" with the specified columns:

python
Copy code
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from django.db import connection

class TodoCreateAPIView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        try:
            with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                # Create the table if it doesn't exist
                cursor.execute(
                    '''
                    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todo (
                        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                        priority FLOAT,
                        completed BOOL,
                        task VARCHAR(255),
                        due_date DATE,
                        created_at TIMESTAMP
                    )
                    '''
                )
                return Response(
                    {'message': 'Table created successfully'},
                    status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED
                )
        except Exception as e:
            return Response(
                {'message': 'Failed to create table: {}'.format(str(e))},
                status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
            )
This class defines a post method which executes the SQL statement to create the "todo" table using Django's database connection. The try-except block handles any potential exceptions that might occur during the table creation process. If the table is created successfully, it returns a response with a status code of 201 (HTTP_CREATED) and a success message. If an error occurs, it returns a response with a status code of 500 (HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR) and an error message.

Remember to configure your Django project to include this endpoint in the URL routing, and make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Django and Django REST framework.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Django GraphQL endpoint for creating a table called "Todo" with the specified columns:

python
Copy code
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType

class TodoType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Todo
        fields = ('id', 'priority', 'completed', 'task', 'due_date', 'created_at')

class CreateTodoMutation(graphene.Mutation):
    class Arguments:
        priority = graphene.Float(required=True)
        completed = graphene.Boolean(required=True)
        task = graphene.String(required=True)
        due_date = graphene.Date(required=True)

    todo = graphene.Field(TodoType)

    @classmethod
    def mutate(cls, root, info, priority, completed, task, due_date):
        todo = Todo.objects.create(priority=priority, completed=completed, task=task, due_date=due_date)
        return CreateTodoMutation(todo=todo)

class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    create_todo = CreateTodoMutation.Field()

schema = graphene.Schema(mutation=Mutation)
In this example, we define a GraphQL TodoType using graphene_django.DjangoObjectType, which automatically generates the GraphQL fields based on the Todo model. We also define a CreateTodoMutation mutation that takes the required arguments for creating a new todo. Inside the mutate method, we create a new Todo instance with the provided data and return it.

To use this GraphQL endpoint, you'll need to configure your Django project to include the necessary GraphQL dependencies, such as graphene, graphene-django, and the GraphQL endpoint URL in your URL routing. You'll also need to define the Todo model and import it in the code.

Make sure to adjust the code based on your project structure and import the necessary dependencies accordingly.
