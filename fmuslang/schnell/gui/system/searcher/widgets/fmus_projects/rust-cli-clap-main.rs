// This example sets up a simple CLI application with two required positional arguments: input and output. 
// You can customize the application further by adding more arguments, flags, or subcommands according to your needs.

// Clap provides extensive documentation, including examples and tutorials, which you can find on the official Clap repository on GitHub: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap

// Additionally, if you prefer a more opinionated CLI framework for Rust, you might consider looking into "structopt." 
// Structopt is built on top of Clap and provides a procedural macro-based approach for defining CLI interfaces. 
// It simplifies the process by automatically deriving the necessary code based on your defined structures and annotations. 
// Structopt can be useful for reducing boilerplate code when building CLI applications in Rust.

// You can find more information and examples of Structopt in the official repository: https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt
