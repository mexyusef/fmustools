# TDD Examples in Go.
TDD in Go Echo: show me some examples

ChatGPT
Certainly! Test-driven development (TDD) is a popular approach to software development where tests are written before the actual code. It helps ensure that the code meets the desired requirements and remains maintainable over time. Here are some examples of TDD in Go using the Echo web framework:

Installing Dependencies:
Before starting, make sure you have Go and Echo installed on your machine. You can install Echo using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
Writing a Simple Test:
Let's start with a simple example of testing a handler function in Echo. Create a new file called main_test.go with the following code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"

    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {
    // Create a new Echo instance
    e := echo.New()

    // Create a new HTTP request to the endpoint
    req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/", nil)
    rec := httptest.NewRecorder()
    c := e.NewContext(req, rec)

    // Invoke the handler
    HelloWorldHandler(c)

    // Check the response
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, rec.Code)
    assert.Equal(t, "Hello, World!", rec.Body.String())
}
Writing the Handler Function:
In the same package, create a file called main.go with the following code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

func HelloWorldHandler(c echo.Context) error {
    return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, World!")
}

func main() {
    e := echo.New()
    e.GET("/", HelloWorldHandler)
    e.Start(":8080")
}
Running the Test:
In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the test and code files, and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test
You should see the output indicating that the test passed.

These examples demonstrate a simple test for an Echo handler function. You can expand on this approach to write more tests for different routes and functionalities in your Echo application.
