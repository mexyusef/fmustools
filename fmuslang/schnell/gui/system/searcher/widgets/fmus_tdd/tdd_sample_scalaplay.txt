TDD in Play Scala: show me some examples

Certainly! Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that involves writing tests before writing the actual implementation code. It helps ensure that the code is robust and that new changes don't introduce regressions.

Here are some examples of how you can use TDD in Play Scala:

Controller Testing:

scala
Copy code
import org.scalatestplus.play._
import org.scalatestplus.play.guice._
import play.api.test._
import play.api.test.Helpers._

class MyControllerSpec extends PlaySpec with GuiceOneAppPerTest {
  "MyController" should {
    "return a successful response" in {
      val controller = app.injector.instanceOf[MyController]
      val request = FakeRequest(GET, "/my-route")
      val result = controller.myAction().apply(request)

      status(result) mustBe OK
    }

    "return a specific response body" in {
      val controller = app.injector.instanceOf[MyController]
      val request = FakeRequest(GET, "/my-route")
      val result = controller.myAction().apply(request)

      contentAsString(result) must include("Expected response")
    }
  }
}
In this example, we're testing a controller called MyController. We create fake requests using FakeRequest and invoke the controller's action. We then use ScalaTest matchers to assert the expected response status and response body.

Service Testing:

scala
Copy code
import org.scalatestplus.play._
import org.scalatestplus.play.guice._
import play.api.inject.bind
import play.api.inject.guice.GuiceApplicationBuilder
import play.api.test._

class MyServiceSpec extends PlaySpec with GuiceOneAppPerTest {
  "MyService" should {
    "return the expected result" in {
      val mockDependency = mock[MyDependency]
      when(mockDependency.doSomething()).thenReturn("Expected result")

      val app = new GuiceApplicationBuilder()
        .overrides(bind[MyDependency].toInstance(mockDependency))
        .build()

      val service = app.injector.instanceOf[MyService]
      val result = service.doSomething()

      result mustBe "Expected result"
    }
  }
}
In this example, we're testing a service called MyService that has a dependency on MyDependency. We use Mockito to mock the dependency and define the expected behavior. We then create an instance of the application with the mock dependency bound, and finally, we test the service's method.

These are just basic examples to illustrate the idea of TDD in Play Scala. You can extend and customize the tests according to your application's specific requirements. Remember to include the necessary testing libraries, such as ScalaTest and Mockito, in your project dependencies.

Note: It's assumed that you have the required testing dependencies and configurations set up in your Play Scala project.
