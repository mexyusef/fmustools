# TDD Go CLI Cobra: Examples
TDD in Go CLI Cobra: show me some examples

ChatGPT
Certainly! I can provide you with a basic example of how to use Test-Driven Development (TDD) with the Go CLI library Cobra. In this example, we'll create a simple CLI application that calculates the square of a given number. We'll follow the TDD approach by writing the tests first and then implementing the functionality.

Here's an example directory structure for our project:

go
Copy code
myapp/
  ├── cmd/
  │   └── myapp/
  │       └── main.go
  └── square/
      ├── square.go
      └── square_test.go
First, let's create the square package and its corresponding test file.

square/square.go:

go
Copy code
package square

// Square calculates the square of a given number.
func Square(num int) int {
    return num * num
}
square/square_test.go:

go
Copy code
package square

import "testing"

func TestSquare(t *testing.T) {
    result := Square(2)
    expected := 4

    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("Expected %d, but got %d", expected, result)
    }
}
Now, let's create the myapp command using Cobra.

cmd/myapp/main.go:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
    "myapp/square"
)

var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "myapp",
    Short: "A simple CLI application",
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        if len(args) == 0 {
            cmd.Usage()
            return
        }

        num := args[0]
        squareNum := square.Square(num)
        fmt.Printf("Square of %s is %d\n", num, squareNum)
    },
}

func main() {
    if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
Now we can run our tests and build the CLI application. Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run the following commands:

$ go test ./...
$ go build -o myapp ./cmd/myapp
Finally, you can use your CLI application like this:

$ ./myapp 5
Square of 5 is 25

That's a basic example of using TDD with Cobra in a Go CLI application. You can expand upon this by adding more commands, flags, and tests as needed for your application.
