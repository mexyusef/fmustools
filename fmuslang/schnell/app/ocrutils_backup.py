# # Philanthropy

# The Negro race in America owes a mighty debt, first, to that army of teachers that followed the emancipating hosts of the Civil War and taught the colored people until they were able in measure to teach themselves; secondly, to the many millions of people, some rich and some poor, who now for a half-century have been giving monies to support Negro education. It is not strange that the time is approaching and practically is upon us when the stream of financial help from this source is beginning to cease. We must frankly face the prospect that after the war when new calls for help and rehabilitation pour in from all sides and ask aid and succor from an impoverished world that the flow of Northern wealth to Southern colored schools will definitely diminish. This is natural. No system of higher education for twelve million people can expect to be supported indefinitely by charity. If turning from individual donors we look to the great educational boards, foundations and endowments there is little to hope for. For the most part these foundations are either such as are hard-pressed for funds, as in the case of the church boards, or have ideas with regard to the education of Negroes with which thinking Negroes do not agree.

# What, then, is the future of higher education among Negroes to be? Three universities, Howard, Fisk and Lincoln, are probably upon an assured basis; the last two by reason of small endowments, the first because the Negro vote in the United States will probably insure continued appropriations by Congress. These universities, however, are ridiculously inadequate. We may then turn to those colleges under the control of the various denominational boards---the Congregationalists can, if they wish, use enough of their endowment funds to support Talladega and Straight as higher institutions, and they may do so. The colored constituency of the Methodist Episcopal Church will probably compel the maintenance at a fair state of efficiency of some schools like Claflin, Bennett and Clark. The Baptists are in a more debatable condition. Their Negro constituency has for the most part withdrawn its self and is supporting its own schools, leaving the white Baptists with a small Negro constituency to support schools like Morehouse, Shaw and Virginia Union.

# ## Self-Help

# Negro universities and schools of higher training have got to be supported by Negroes or, for the most part, they will not be supported at all. If we black folk want college training for our children, we have got to furnish it out of our own pockets. This is a harsh conclusion and in many respects an unfair burden. If men were wise and if sociology were a science, it would be easy for Negroes to show that people of the United States that the safest and greatest investment the this country could make of a thousand millions of dollars during the next decade would be the establishment of a series of Negro universities and higher technical schools throughout the United States. But the nation does not see it and will not see it for one hundred years. Human beings today have been educated to the point where they recognize the need of philanthropy for the hungry, the cripple, the grossly ignorant. Many have been educated also to see the just demand of philanthropy for the diseased, the weak and the half-trained. Beyond

# ## The Future of Africa

# In the early days of the European War an article by Dr. Burghardt Du Bois wrote in Dr. W. E. B. the Atlantic Monthly on "The African Roots of War." Of the many discussions of the cause of the great conflict none was more timely or important. In the article in question the writer points out that today, as so often in the past, the wealth of Africa leads to a common lust for conquest and exploitation in the native population. This was displayed in most barbarous form in the old days of the Belgian Congo Free State and in the recent days of the German colonies. But none of the colonial powers are without guilt since all look upon the natives, not as people to be educated and encouraged to self-development, but as ignorant laborers to be used for the propagation of wealth which the European oppressors leave to spend in his own land. This exploitation carries with it intense race prejudice and results in increasingly confining the black man to those places where iron, for climate, historical and political reasons, is most difficult to live and most easily dominated by Europe for Europe's gain.

# This is the picture of Africa today, but now, with the end of the war, we look to the future of the Africa of the future. This picture is being widely discussed and will be one of the most important of the problems to be decided at the Peace Conference. The N. A. A. C. P. stands on the following platform drawn up by Dr. Du Bois:

# 1. The barter of colonies without regard to the wishes or welfare of the inhabitants or the welfare of the world in general is a custom to which this war should put an end, since it is a fruitful cause of dissension among nations, a danger to the peace of civilized labor, a temptation to unbridled exploitation, and an excuse for unspeakable atrocities committed against natives.

# 2. It is clear that at least one of Germany's specific objects in the present war was the extension of her African colonies at the expense of France and Portugal.

# 3. As a result of the War, the German colonies in Africa have been seized by the Allies, and the question of their disposition must come before the Peace Conference. Responsible English statesmen have announced that their return to Germany is unthinkable.

# 4. However, to take German Africa from one imperial master, even though a bad one, and hand it over to another, even though a better one, would inevitably arouse a suspicion of selfish aims on the part of the Allies and would leave after the war the grave questions of future colonial possessions and government.

# 5. While the principle of self-determination which has been recognized as a fundamental by the Allies cannot be wholly applied to semi-civilized peoples, yet, as the English Prime Minister has acknowledged, it can be partially applied.

# 6. The problem opinion which in the case of the former German colonies should have the decisive voice is composed of:

#   (a) The Chiefs and intelligent Negroes among the twelve and one-half million natives of German Africa, especially those trained in the government and mission schools.

#   (b) The twelve million civilized Negroes of the United States.

#   (c) Educated persons of Negro descent in South America and the West Indies.

#   (d) The independent Negro governments of Abyssinia, Liberia, and Haiti.

#   (e) The educated classes among the Negroes of French West Africa and Equatorial Africa and in British Uganda, Nigeria, Basutoland, Nyassaland, Swaziland, Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Gambia and Bechuanaland, and the four and one-half millions of colored people in the Union of South Africa.

# These classes comprise today the thinking elements of the future Negro world and their wish should have weight in the future disposition of the German colonies.

# 7. The first step toward ascertaining the desires, aspirations and grievances of these people should be the calling together of a Pan-African Congress, to meet in Paris sometime during the sessions of the Peace Conference.

# 8. If the world area after the war decided to reconstruct Africa in accordance with the wishes of the Negro race and the best interests of civilization, the process might be carried out as follows: The former German colonies, with one million square miles and twelve and one-half millions of inhabitants, could be internationalized. The 800,000 square miles and by nine million inhabitants of Portuguese Africa. It is not impossible that Belgium could be persuaded to add to such a state the 900,000 square miles and nine million natives of the Congo, making in international Africa, with over two and one-half million square miles of land and over twenty million people.

# 9. This re-organized Africa could be under the guidance of organized civilization. The Governing International Commission should represent, not simply governments, but modern culture—science, commerce, social reform, and religious philanthropy.

# 10. With these few principles in the practical policies to be followed out the governmental of the new state should involve a thorough and complete system of modern education built upon the present government, religion and customary law of the natives. There should be no violent tampering with the curiously efficient African institutions of local self-government through the family and the tribe; there should be no attempt at sudden “conversion” by religious propaganda. Obviously deleterious customs and unsanitary usages must gradually be abolished and careful religious teaching given, but the general government set up from without must follow the example of the best colonial administrations and build on recognized established foundations rather than from entirely new and theoretical plans.

# # Editorial

# On the boards which control the administration of funds for the colored public schools the colored race must be represented. They must have a voice in their own education.

# ## Philanthropy

# The Negro race in America owes a mighty debt, first, to that army of teachers that followed the emancipating hosts of the Civil War and taught the colored people until they were able in measure to teach themselves; secondly, to the many millions of people, some rich and some poor, who now for a half-century have been giving monies to support Negro education. It is not strange that the time is approaching and practically is upon us when the stream of financial help from this source is beginning to cease. We must frankly face the prospect that after the war when new calls for help and rehabilitation pour in from all sides and ask aid and succor from an impoverished world that the flow of Northern wealth to Southern colored schools will definitely diminish. This is natural. No system of higher education for twelve million people can expect to be supported indefinitely by charity. If turning from individual donors we look to the great educational boards, foundations and endowments there is little to hope for. For the most part these foundations are either such as are hard-pressed for funds, as in the case of the church boards, or have ideas with regard to the education of Negroes with which thinking Negroes do not agree.

# What, then, is the future of higher education among Negroes to be? Three universities, Howard, Fisk and Lincoln, are probably upon an assured basis; the last two by reason of small endowments, the first because the Negro vote in the United States will probably insure continued appropriations by Congress. These universities, however, are ridiculously inadequate. We may then turn to those colleges under the control of the various denominational boards,---The Congregationalists can, if they wish, use enough of their endowment funds to support Talladega and Straight as higher institutions, and they may do so. The colored constituency of the Methodist Episcopal Church will probably compel the maintenance at a fair state of efficiency of some schools like Claflin, Bennett and Clarke. The Baptists are in a more debatable condition. Their Negro constituency has for the most part withdrawn to itself and is supporting its own schools, leaving the white Baptists with a small Negro constituency to support schools like Morehouse, Shaw and Virginia Union.

# ## Self-Help

# Negro universities and schools of higher training have got to be supported by Negroes or, for the most part, they will not be supported at all. If we block folk want college training for our children, we have got to furnish it out of our own pockets. This is a harsh conclusion and in many respects an unfair burden.

But the nation does not see it and will not see it for one hundred years. Human beings today have been educated to the point where they recognize the need of philanthropy for the hungry, the cripple, the grossly ignorant. Many have been educated also to see the just demand of philanthropy for the diseased, the weak and the half-trained. Beyond
