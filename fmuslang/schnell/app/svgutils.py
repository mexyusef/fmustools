# I would suggest using potrace for python.
# Use this link: https://pypi.org/project/pypotrace/
# Here is the documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/pypotrace/ref.html#

# Like This:
# from potrace import Bitmap

# # Initialize data, for example convert a PIL image to a numpy array
# # [...]

# bitmap = Bitmap(data)
# path = bitmap.trace()
