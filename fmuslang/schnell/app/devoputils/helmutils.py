# give me python functions i need to use if i want to be able to administrate Helm that are used along with kubernetes and terraform for enterprise fullstack application in my company?
# ChatGPT
# To administer Helm, Kubernetes, and Terraform for an enterprise full-stack application, you'll need a combination of Python libraries and tools that interact with these technologies. Here's a list of Python functions and libraries you might find useful:

# Helm Administration:

# Helm Python Library: You can use the helm Python library to interact with Helm from your Python scripts. It allows you to install, upgrade, and manage Helm charts.



from helm import Helm

def coba_helm():
    helm = Helm()
    helm.install(chart='my-chart', release='my-release')
# Kubernetes Administration:

# Kubernetes Python Client (kubectl): The kubectl command-line tool can be used from Python scripts using subprocess or the kubectl Python library.



import subprocess

def kubectl_apply(manifest_file):
    subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'apply', '-f', manifest_file])

# Kubernetes API Client: You can use the official Kubernetes Python client to interact with the Kubernetes API directly.



from kubernetes import client, config

def coba_kube():
    config.load_kube_config()

    v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
    print("Listing pods with their IPs:")
    ret = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
    for i in ret.items:
        print("%s\t%s\t%s" % (i.status.pod_ip, i.metadata.namespace, i.metadata.name))
# Terraform Administration:

# Terraform Python Client: The python-terraform library allows you to execute Terraform commands from Python.



from python_terraform import Terraform

def coba_coba():
    tf = Terraform(working_dir='./path/to/terraform/config')
    tf.init()
    tf.apply()
# Terraform Module Management: You might want to use Python functions to manage Terraform modules and configurations dynamically.

# Integration Functions:

# Orchestration Functions: If you need to orchestrate the deployment or maintenance of Helm charts, Kubernetes resources, and Terraform configurations, you might want to use a task runner like invoke or fabric.



from invoke import task

@task
def deploy():
    # Your deployment logic here
    pass
# Logging and Monitoring Functions: Depending on your requirements, you might want to integrate logging and monitoring tools into your Python scripts to keep track of deployments and infrastructure changes.

# Remember to install the necessary Python libraries using tools like pip:

# pip install helm python-terraform kubernetes

# Additionally, make sure you have the necessary executables installed on your system, such as Helm, kubectl, and Terraform, as these Python libraries often rely on the corresponding command-line tools.

# give me python functions instead, related to terraform
# ChatGPT
# Certainly! When working with Terraform in Python, you can use the python-terraform library to interact with Terraform configurations and perform operations. Below are some example Python functions using the python-terraform library:

# Initialize Terraform:


from python_terraform import Terraform

def initialize_terraform(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    tf.init()
# Apply Terraform Configuration:


def apply_terraform(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.apply()
# Destroy Terraform Resources:


def destroy_terraform(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.destroy()
# Get Terraform Output:


def get_terraform_output(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.output()
# Show Terraform Plan:


def show_terraform_plan(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.plan()
# Terraform Variable Setters:


def set_terraform_variable(working_dir, variable_name, variable_value):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    tf.var(variable_name=variable_name, value=variable_value)
# Terraform State Management:


def show_terraform_state(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.state(show=True)
# Check if Terraform Configuration is Valid:


def validate_terraform_config(working_dir):
    tf = Terraform(working_dir=working_dir)
    return tf.validate()
# Make sure to install the python-terraform library using:


# pip install python-terraform

# Adjust the functions based on your specific needs and integrate them into your deployment or automation scripts as required.

# User

# To interact with Helm in Python, you can use the helm library. Here are some example Python functions that use the helm library to perform common Helm operations:

# Install Helm Chart:


from helm import Helm

def install_helm_chart(chart, release):
    helm = Helm()
    helm.install(chart=chart, release=release)
# Upgrade Helm Release:


def upgrade_helm_release(chart, release):
    helm = Helm()
    helm.upgrade(chart=chart, release=release)
# List Helm Releases:


def list_helm_releases():
    helm = Helm()
    return helm.list_releases()
# Uninstall Helm Release:


def uninstall_helm_release(release):
    helm = Helm()
    helm.uninstall(release=release)
# Get Helm Release Values:


def get_helm_release_values(release):
    helm = Helm()
    return helm.get_values(release=release)
# Get Helm Release Status:


def get_helm_release_status(release):
    helm = Helm()
    return helm.status(release=release)
# Rollback Helm Release:


def rollback_helm_release(release, revision):
    helm = Helm()
    helm.rollback(release=release, revision=revision)
# Search Helm Chart Repositories:


def search_helm_charts(keyword):
    helm = Helm()
    return helm.search_charts(keyword=keyword)
# Make sure to install the helm library using:


# pip install helm

# Adjust these functions based on your specific Helm chart and release management requirements. Incorporate these functions into your Python scripts or automation workflows as needed.
